# Tanzania Faulty Water Pumps Prediction

## Pumps States Analysis and Modelisation 

Mahdi KRIAA

Welcome to this project which aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the operational status of water pumps in Tanzania. The goal is to identify faulty water pumps before they fail, allowing for timely maintenance and minimizing downtime. Water supply in Tanzania is critical, and pump failures can have significant impacts on local communities. By predicting these failures, we can ensure a more reliable water supply and improve the quality of life for these communities.
